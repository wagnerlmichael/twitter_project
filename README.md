# Rough Draft of Twitter textual analysis

Currently working on finding the best way to clean text data, and which analysis to use. Textblob is the current working package.

Looking to build a program eventually where you can enter a twitter username and # of tweets (+argument for RTs) and return basic textual analysis.
